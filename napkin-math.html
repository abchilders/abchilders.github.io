    you can run this using the URL:
	http://nrs-projects.humboldt.edu/~abc66/for_fun/napkin-math.html

    TO DO: 
		- consolidate videos (thanks to Snapchat segmentation)
		- add paragraph explaining why I would do this at the bottom, 
			with a link at the top bringing you to the bottom and vice versa.
		- validate CSS and XHTML so that I can remove footer

		<img src="images/napkin1.JPG" alt="I have a serious question for you 
			all. What is the most efficient way to use a napkin? That is, how 
			do you fold it so that you get the most use out of its surface 
			area? I want to find out how to calculate the most surface area 
			you can use from a napkin, given a length and width of a napkin." />

			Person folding napkin in half. Caption reads: For instance, I usually 
			start by using one side of the napkin, leaving the other side clean so 
			that I can hold the napkin. Then I fold the napkin in half, exposing all 
			the remaining unused surface area, like so.

	</p>
	
	<p class="snapchat_visual">
		<img src="images/napkin6.JPG" alt="Mathematical calculations. 
		Caption reads: So I crunched the numbers, and it looks like I actually 
		used 98.99% of the napkin. This number seems a little bit too high for 
		me, but surface area has a tendency to produce pretty high numbers that 
		seem improbable to me anyway." />

	<p class="snapchat_visual">
		<img src="images/napkin7.JPG" alt="Napkin with green colored corner.
		Caption reads: Oh, and note that I'm not taking the thickness of the

	</p>
	
	<p class="snapchat_visual">
		<img src="images/napkin8.JPG" alt="Math calculations. Caption reads: 
		If we fold the napkin 6 times, we theoretically should get about 
		99.22% usage out of this napkin. I'm not super worried about making sure 
		I'm accurate to all decimal places, so I'll take this loosely. " />
	</p>
	
	<p class="snapchat_visual">
		<img src="images/napkin9.JPG" alt="Math calculations. Caption reads: 
		Ok! So I think I've found the formula that determines how much surface 
		area you will use (in units squared), given a number of times you can 
		fold the napkin. The premise is that we use half of the remaining 
		surface area, and then we cut that remaining surface area in half and 
		repeat. So we use 1/2 of the napkin area, then 1/4, etc. If we never 
		fold the napkin (0 folds), we use 1/2 of the napkin. Now, how many times 
		can we fold a napkin? " />

		<img src="images/napkin10.JPG" alt="Article about paper folding theorem. 
		Caption reads: A popular myth says that you can fold a piece of paper up 
		to 7 times. this is a good practical bound, but Britney Gallivan proved 
		that it depends on the size of the paper-- she was able to fold a 4000 
		foot length of toilet paper 12 times. She was able to derive an equation 
		determining the width of paper needed to fold a piece of paper n times, 
		if it has a thickness of t. I fold my napkins in alternate directions, 
		so we'll use the second equation. " />
	</p>
	
	<p class="snapchat_visual">
		<img src="images/napkin11.JPG" alt="Article about paper folding theorem. 
		Caption reads: Oh, and the caveat-- W is the width of a *square* piece 
		of paper. One of the editors of this Wikipedia article makes an 
		unsupported claim that this equation is still a good approximation for 
		non-square paper. Practically speaking, I can't see anyone having a napkin 
		with more than a 2:1 length-width ratio, nor a napkin that could be folded 
		more than 7 or 8 times. We'll continue with this equation anyway. " />

	<p class="snapchat_visual">
		<img src="images/napkin12.JPG" alt="Wolfram Alpha search results. 
		Caption reads: I got lazy LOL. I think we can use the real solution. It 
		just assumes that we're working with a square napkin, neither the napkin's 
		thickness nor its width is 0, and the width and thickness must have the 
		same sign. Fair enough. Let's agree not to try calculating non-existent 
		napkins. " />

	<p class="snapchat_visual">
		<img src="images/napkin13.JPG" alt="Article describing solution to a math
		problem. Caption reads: I think that, beyond the formula I 
		calculated, we're getting into some rough approximations here. So we'll 
		take the next few calculations with a grain of salt. This is all recreational 
		math anyway, right? Two sources on Google state that the average sheet of 
		paper is about 0.004 inches thick. I don't have precise enough tools to 
		corroborate this, so let's go with it. " />

	<p class="snapchat_visual">

	</p>
	
	<p class="snapchat_visual">
		<img src="images/napkin20.JPG" alt="Math formulas. Napkin usage = 
		the sum of length times width divided by 2 to the i from i = 0 to

		napkin width. Napkin usage as a percent = (the sum of length times 
		width divided by 2 to the i from i = 0 to n) divided by 2lw times 100. 
		Number of possible folds n = the floor of (2 log ((square root of 2 times w) 
		divided by (pi times t)) divided by 3 log(2) plus 2/3, where w = width, 
		t = napkin thickness, t is not equal to 0, w is not equal to 0, 
		and t and w have the same sign (+ or -). Napkin usage 
		assuming the napkin is square and thickness = 0.01016 cm, the average 
		thickness of a piece of paper = the sum of w square divided by 
		(2 to the i) from i = 0 to 0.0961797 log (89.6136w), where w = napkin
